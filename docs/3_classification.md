# Clasification

Easing functions can be classified into several categories based on their behavior and the way they interpolate values over time. I have classified the ones used in this project into the following:

- **Sine:** Curved path, similar to the shape of a sine wave, gradual acceleration and deceleration.
They are often used for animations that require a fluid and organic movement, such as the movement of waves or the motion of a pendulum.

- **Quadratic:** Accelerate or decelerate the motion at a constant rate.
They can be used to create a sense of momentum or inertia in an animation.

- **Cubic:** Accelerate or decelerate the motion more aggressively than quadratic easing functions.
They can be used to create a more pronounced sense of momentum or to simulate natural movements like bouncing.

- **Quartic:** More aggressive than Cubic.

- **Quintic:** More aggressive than Quartic.

- **Exponential:** Accelerate or decelerate the motion exponentially.
They can be used to create an exaggerated sense of momentum or to simulate movements like a rocket taking off.

- **Circular:** Create a motion that follows a circular path, gradual acceleration and deceleration.
Circular easing functions are often used for animations that involve rotation or circular movement.

- **Back:** Create a motion that overshoots its target and then returns to it.

- **Elastic:** Simulate a spring-like motion where the animation overshoots its target and then bounces back.
They can be used to create a playful or whimsical effect in animations.

- **Bounce:** Simulate a bouncing ball by adding a series of small, quick bounces.

Each category includes three types of functions:

- **Ease In:** Starts the animation slowly and gradually accelerates towards the end.
- **Ease Out:** Starts the animation at full speed and gradually slows down towards the end.
- **Ease InOut:** Starts the animation slowly, accelerates towards the middle, and then gradually slows down towards the end.
